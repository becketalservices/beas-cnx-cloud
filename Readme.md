Create an IBM Component Pack installation on managed Kubernetes
==============================================================

IBM has updated the IBM Connections Component Pack to work on a native Kubernetes installation without IBM Cloud private. This gives everyone the chance to deploy the solution on a managed Kubernetes infrastructure.

IBM has documented the installation of IBM Connections Component Pack on a reference installation which will probably reside in a private data center.

As many companies are now using cloud services, using Kubernetes services out of the cloud should also be an option to host the IBM Connections Component Pack.

This documentation provides information and installation guidelines to get IBM Connections Component Pack running on a managed Kubernetes service on one of the main cloud providers.
