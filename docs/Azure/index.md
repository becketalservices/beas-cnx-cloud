Create a IBM Component Pack installation on Azure
=================================================

This instructions are like a cook book. You can follow them and you will get the desired result when you environment is the same as mine. This instructions were build using a payed account without any restrictions. When you are in a corporate environment there might some restrictions apply. Please check with your entitlement administrator.

The infrastructure requires quite a lot of resources. A Free Tier or Trial Account is not sufficient to install the whole Component Pack
components. Please use a payed account.
